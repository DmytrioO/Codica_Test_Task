Hello, and welcome to my test task for Codica.  
You can see my app on the site: http://209.38.248.103/.

To sign up or sign in as patient you can use 'Sign Up' and
'Sign In' buttons in the header. You can see your profile info
on Profile page(button on header too).
Sign In for doctors is the same as for patients, but register
doctors can only admin. After creating a doctor - all doctors
have password '123#QWEqwe', so they need to change that. It
can be performed by 'Change password' button on the Profile page.
To login as admin, you need to go on the admin_dashboard:  
http://209.38.248.103/admin  
Here you can login, create admins, categories, and doctors.
In the same time you can edit them and delete too.
In this app you can make an appointments for doctor. As patient
you have list of all your appointments on the 
Appointments page(you have such button on the header). Here
you can view all your appointments, and check them. If you
want to view more info, or cancel appointment - click 'View'
between of appointment that you need, and you will go to page
for this appointment.  
As doctor you can manage your appointments. Appointments have
4 statuses - opened(when it only created), in progress(when
doctor started this appointment), closed(when doctor finished
and leave a conclusion for patient) and canceled(when patient
or doctor cancel this appointment). Pay attention - when date
of appointment is in future - doctor can only cancel this 
appointment. When appointment date is today, or in past - 
you have 'In progress' button, that allow you to change 
appointment status. Then, when you are ready to leave a conclusion -
you have 'Finish appointment', that avoids you to leave
your recommendations, and close an appointment.
Also you may know, that one doctor can't have more than 10
appointments, that have status opened or in progress. Doctor
can't make appointment for himself/herself too.  
Enjoy :)
